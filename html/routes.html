            Norwegian Scenic Routes are selected roads that run through
            landscapes with unique natural qualities, along coasts and fjords,
            mountains and waterfalls. The routes are intended as alternatives to
            the main roads, and the drive itself should be an enjoyable
            experience.

                    The Alaska boundary dispute, simmering since the Alaska
                    Purchase of 1867, became critical when gold was discovered
                    in the Yukon during the late 1890s, with the U.S.
                    controlling all the possible ports of entry. Canada argued
                    its boundary included the port of Skagway.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The dispute went to arbitration in 1903, but the British
                    delegate sided with the Americans, angering Canadians who
                    felt the British had betrayed Canadian interests to curry
                    favour with the U.S.

                    Convinced that Canada had proven itself on the battlefields
                    of Europe, Prime Minister Robert Borden demanded that it
                    have a separate seat at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.
                    This was initially opposed not only by Britain but also by
                    the United States, which saw such a delegation as an extra
                    British vote.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Borden responded by pointing out that since Canada had lost
                    nearly 60,000 men, a far larger proportion of its men, its
                    right to equal status as a nation had been consecrated on
                    the battlefield.

                    Throughout the mid-1950s, prime ministers Louis St. Laurent
                    and his successor John Diefenbaker attempted to create a
                    new, highly advanced jet fighter, the Avro Arrow. The
                    controversial aircraft was cancelled by Diefenbaker in 1959.

                    <br />
                    Diefenbaker instead purchased the BOMARC missile defence
                    system and American aircraft. In 1958 Canada established
                    (with the United States) the North American Aerospace
                    Defense Command (NORAD).

                    By 1957 the Suez crisis alienated Canada from both Britain
                    and France; politicians distrusted American leadership,
                    businessmen questioned American financial investments; and
                    intellectuals ridiculed the values of American television
                    and Hollywood offerings that all Canadians watched.

                    considerable antagonism and growing western alienation.

                    Stephen Harper's Conservative government, which proposed a

                    Looking back on 2020, it's hard to believe all that has
                    happened. From a global pandemic to social unrest and

                    all, Canada has remained a strong and stable force. Our
                    diverse population has come together to support each other
                    during these difficult times. We continue to stand united
                    against racism and hatred.

                    We will continue to work hard to keep our country safe and
                    prosperous, and we will never give up fighting for a better

            <p>
              Like ancient slumbering giants, the mountains line the road that
              takes you alongside Rondane National Park. The slowly changing
              landscape with its towering mountains is a memorable experience.
              <br /><br />
              2,000 metre-high summits in a singular landscape decked in
              blinding on the glittering snow, the bluish light. The quiet
              tranquility. Perhaps it is this feeling that has made so many
              artists and writers find inspiration in Rondane - and maybe this
              is why people return to Rondane again and again over generations.

              the horizon from here. Atlanterhavsvegen has been described as the

                In Norway you can do cross-country skiing almost anywhere in the
                country. Some destinations are, however, especially suitable and
                fun for ski fans, whether they are great athletes, families or
                beginners.
                <br /><br />
                Here you can experience the best of the Norwegian winter, with
                and without skis. Sign up for a guided excursion or join a ski
                course. The next day you can always recover your strength on a
                sled, whether sliding down a slope or letting yourself be
                carried by a group of dogs. Norway's main alpine ski resorts
                also offer fantastic opportunities for cross-country skiing.
                They have an excellent network of slopes where you can easily
                combine various activities.

                In the center of Oslo, a new building stands next to the fjord
                that has transformed the architectural skyline of the city.
                Apart from the exhibitions, the museum hosts different programs
                of shows, literature, music, cinema and dance.
                <br /><br />
                The objective that has been pursued with the construction of the
                new MUNCH is to make the city more attractive to Oslense, as
                well as providing another incentive to visit the Norwegian
                capital.
                <br /><br />
                The Spanish architecture studio Estudio Herreros is behind the
                design of this extremely tall sixty-metre building, which has
                managed to reduce the emissions of other buildings.

                From ancient petroglyphs to impressive fjordside landscapes to
                early industrialization sites: Norway has nine places and areas
                that, due to their cultural and natural value, are part of the
                UNESCO World Heritage List.
                <br /><br />
                One of the missions of Unesco is the conservation and protection
                of natural landscapes and irreplaceable historical buildings and
                monuments.
                <br /><br />
                The choice of these places is based on ten criteria that include
                innovation, historical relevance or unique nature. These World
                Heritage Sites are spread all over the world, today there are
                more than 1,000 and nine of them are in Norway.
