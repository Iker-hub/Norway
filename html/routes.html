            <br /><br />
            Norwegian Scenic Routes are selected roads that run through
            landscapes with unique natural qualities, along coasts and fjords,
            mountains and waterfalls. The routes are intended as alternatives to
            the main roads, and the drive itself should be an enjoyable
            experience.

                      Varangerbotn is about the long lines in the landscape, as
                      well as the long lines of history. Proximity to Russia,
                      Finnish immigration and Sami traditions provide the area
                      with exciting cultural diversity.
                      <br /><br />
                      The drive runs through birch woods, marshland and a rugged
                      cliff landscape. The light is special and the bird life
                      and wildlife unique. Species of birds that you won’t find
                      anywhere else in the world are relatively easily
                      accessible. There is also a good chance of experiencing
                      reindeer at first hand along this road.

                In Norway you can do cross-country skiing almost anywhere in the
                country. Some destinations are, however, especially suitable and
                fun for ski fans, whether they are great athletes, families or
                beginners.
                <br /><br />
                Here you can experience the best of the Norwegian winter, with
                and without skis. Sign up for a guided excursion or join a ski
                course. The next day you can always recover your strength on a
                sled, whether sliding down a slope or letting yourself be
                carried by a group of dogs. Norway's main alpine ski resorts
                also offer fantastic opportunities for cross-country skiing.
                They have an excellent network of slopes where you can easily
                combine various activities.

                In the center of Oslo, a new building stands next to the fjord
                that has transformed the architectural skyline of the city.
                Apart from the exhibitions, the museum hosts different programs
                of shows, literature, music, cinema and dance.
                <br /><br />
                The objective that has been pursued with the construction of the
                new MUNCH is to make the city more attractive to Oslense, as
                well as providing another incentive to visit the Norwegian
                capital.
                <br /><br />
                The Spanish architecture studio Estudio Herreros is behind the
                design of this extremely tall sixty-metre building, which has
                managed to reduce the emissions of other buildings.

                From ancient petroglyphs to impressive fjordside landscapes to
                early industrialization sites: Norway has nine places and areas
                that, due to their cultural and natural value, are part of the
                UNESCO World Heritage List.
                <br /><br />
                One of the missions of Unesco is the conservation and protection
                of natural landscapes and irreplaceable historical buildings and
                monuments.
                <br /><br />
                The choice of these places is based on ten criteria that include
                innovation, historical relevance or unique nature. These World
                Heritage Sites are spread all over the world, today there are
                more than 1,000 and nine of them are in Norway.
