            Scenic Routes.
            <br /><br />
            Norwegian Scenic Routes are selected roads that run through
            landscapes with unique natural qualities, along coasts and fjords,
            mountains and waterfalls. The routes are intended as alternatives to
            the main roads, and the drive itself should be an enjoyable
            experience.

                    <p>
                      Varangerbotn is about the long lines in the landscape, as
                      well as the long lines of history. Proximity to Russia,
                      Finnish immigration and Sami traditions provide the area
                      with exciting cultural diversity.
                      <br /><br />
                      The drive runs through birch woods, marshland and a rugged
                      cliff landscape. The light is special and the bird life
                      and wildlife unique. Species of birds that you won’t find
                      anywhere else in the world are relatively easily
                      accessible. There is also a good chance of experiencing
                      reindeer at first hand along this road.

                      <br /><br />
                      The scorched-earth tactics used by the retreating German
                      army during the Second World War left Finnmark and
                      northern Troms counties in flames. Miraculously Nesseby
                      church remained unscathed. The church was built in 1858
                      and has a baroque altarpiece dating from around 1720.

                      Domen is known from folklore as the place where witches
                      would have their meetings with Satan. At the top of this
                      mountain, has been established a shelter for resting and
                      enjoying the majestic view.
                      <br /><br />
                      The project consists of three small buildings positioned
                      to provide shelter and protect you from the elements. The
                      buildings have steel frameworks, with whitewashed pine
                      panelling on the outside and Norwegian Kebony wood on the
                      inside. The windows are lightly tinted in pink to prevent
                      birds from flying into the glass.

                      The artist Louise Bourgeois and the architect Peter
                      Zumthor have joined in creating evocative space, a burning

                    <p>
                      Along Varangerfjorden we have developed a series of bird
                      hides in places where birds gather and stay.
                      <br /><br />
                      Varanger is one of the few places in the world where you
                      can easily seek out Arctic birds in their natural habitat.
                      Such birds are usually only found in inaccessible places
                      such as Siberia and northern Canada.
                      <br /><br />
                      From the hide in Hamningberg you can study these birds and
                      enjoy the Arctic scenery, well protected from wind and
                      weather.

                    <p>
                      Like ancient slumbering giants, the mountains line the
                      road that takes you alongside Rondane National Park. The
                      slowly changing landscape with its towering mountains is a
                      memorable experience.
                      <br /><br />
                      2,000 metre-high summits in a singular landscape decked in
                      blinding on the glittering snow, the bluish light. The
                      quiet tranquility. Perhaps it is this feeling that has
                      made so many artists and writers find inspiration in
                      Rondane - and maybe this is why people return to Rondane
                      again and again over generations.

                    <h1>Sollia's<br />wooden church</h1>
                    <p>
                      In 1720 a law was introduced that required people to go to
                      church twice each year.
                      <br /><br />
                      The inhabitants of the Setningsdalen valley had to make
                      the long trek across the mountains to Ringebu, and on one
                      occasion an entire group of travellers froze to death. In
                      1732, the king granted permission to build a new church,
                      but the inhabitants of Sollia did not receive any funds
                      for construction. As a result, the local parishioners
                      mustered the ground, timber and stone to build the church
                      themselves. The timbered church was completed in 1738.

                      <br /><br />
                      Fossehuset, the museum at Atnbrufossen waterfall, lies in
                      a verdant birch grove. The Water Works Museum represents
                      the old building custom in timber, while the new
                      Fossehuset shows the modern use of wood as a building
                      material. The building was formerly a sawmill with
                      timber-floating facilities and a hydropower station, but
                      is now also a venue for art exhibitions and concerts.

                      Strømbu is one of the main gateways to the Rondane massif
                      and an excellent starting point for hikes in what was
                      Norway’s first national park. The rest area has a roof
                      terrace and a lounge directly adjacent to the river Atna
                      that winds between pine trees and sand banks. The roof
                      terrace provides a place to rest and admire the view of
                      the mountains and the river.
                      <br /><br />
                      The very first ideas of the project were quite simple and
                      maybe somewhat banal: to make the building as a first
                      movement - a step or a small steep hill towards the
                      distant mountains.

                      The Folldal Mines are one of Norway’s foremost technical
                      and industrial heritage sites, with approximately 70 well
                      preserved buildings.
                      <br /><br />
                      The mines were in operation from 1748 to 1993, producing
                      copper, zinc and sulphur. Barracks for the workers and the
                      director’s mansion containing the luxuries of the era bear
                      witness to the class distinctions that characterised this
                      mining community. Below the mining installations there is
                      a car park with an information board and a viewing point.

                      give the area a uniqueness that is worth preserving.
                      Farstadbukta bay area is therefore protected as a nature
                      reserve.
                      <br /><br />
                      From the beach at Farstadsanden you can take a 2.5 km walk
                      (one way) out to Nordneset Lighthouse. The coastal trail
                      starts at the end of the beach and follows the coastline
                      to the lighthouse. The walk is quite an experience, in

                In Norway you can do cross-country skiing almost anywhere in the
                country. Some destinations are, however, especially suitable and
                fun for ski fans, whether they are great athletes, families or
                beginners.
                <br /><br />
                Here you can experience the best of the Norwegian winter, with
                and without skis. Sign up for a guided excursion or join a ski
                course. The next day you can always recover your strength on a
                sled, whether sliding down a slope or letting yourself be
                carried by a group of dogs. Norway's main alpine ski resorts
                also offer fantastic opportunities for cross-country skiing.
                They have an excellent network of slopes where you can easily
                combine various activities.

                In the center of Oslo, a new building stands next to the fjord
                that has transformed the architectural skyline of the city.
                Apart from the exhibitions, the museum hosts different programs
                of shows, literature, music, cinema and dance.
                <br /><br />
                The objective that has been pursued with the construction of the
                new MUNCH is to make the city more attractive to Oslense, as
                well as providing another incentive to visit the Norwegian
                capital.
                <br /><br />
                The Spanish architecture studio Estudio Herreros is behind the
                design of this extremely tall sixty-metre building, which has
                managed to reduce the emissions of other buildings.

                From ancient petroglyphs to impressive fjordside landscapes to
                early industrialization sites: Norway has nine places and areas
                that, due to their cultural and natural value, are part of the
                UNESCO World Heritage List.
                <br /><br />
                One of the missions of Unesco is the conservation and protection
                of natural landscapes and irreplaceable historical buildings and
                monuments.
                <br /><br />
                The choice of these places is based on ten criteria that include
                innovation, historical relevance or unique nature. These World
                Heritage Sites are spread all over the world, today there are
                more than 1,000 and nine of them are in Norway.
