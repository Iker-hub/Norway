            Norwegian Scenic Routes are selected roads that run through
            landscapes with unique natural qualities, along coasts and fjords,
            mountains and waterfalls. The routes are intended as alternatives to
            the main roads, and the drive itself should be an enjoyable
            experience.

            <p>
              Varangerbotn is about the long lines in the landscape, as well as
              the long lines of history. Proximity to Russia, Finnish
              immigration and Sami traditions provide the area with exciting
              cultural diversity.
              <br /><br />
              The drive runs through birch woods, marshland and a rugged cliff
              landscape. The light is special and the bird life and wildlife
              unique. Species of birds that you won't find anywhere else in the
              world are relatively easily accesible. There is also good change
              of experiencing reindeer at first hand along this road.

              Like ancient slumbering giants, the mountains line the road that
              takes you alongside Rondane National Park. The slowly changing
              landscape with its towering mountains is a memorable experience.
              <br /><br />
              2,000 metre-high summits in a singular landscape decked in
              blinding on the glittering snow, the bluish light. The quiet
              tranquility. Perhaps it is this feeling that has made so many
              artists and writers find inspiration in Rondane - and maybe this
              is why people return to Rondane again and again over generations.

              Bud is a visual delight as it curves elegantly from islet to islet

              create this highly unique driving experience.

              The trip takes you from the fertite cultural landscape of the
              coast across moorland to bare crags along the weather-beaten, open
              bay of Hustadvika. Take time to watch the sun disappearing below
              the horizon from here. Atlanterhavsvegen has been described as the
              world's most beautiful drive.
