              There are direct flights to Norway from many parts of the world
              and if you live in a neighboring country you can get there by
              boat, train or bus and even driving.
              <br /><br />
              Oslo's is the country's main airport and where most international
              flights arrive. It has connections with more than 100
              destinations. Keep in mind, however, that you may have to change
              planes before reaching your final destination.
              <br /><br />
              Other international airports are located in and around Bergen,
              Kristiansand, Sandefjord, Stavanger, Tromsø and Trondheim.
              <br /><br />
              There are direct flights to Norway from both coasts of the United
              States and from several cities in Europe. If you are traveling
              from Australia or New Zealand you have to stop at an airport in
              Asia, the Middle East or Europe.
              <br /><br />
              All large cities and populations of a certain size have airports,
              both for domestic and international flights. There are more than
              50 airports in Norway that make it possible to easily reach the
              most remote destinations, such as the Lofoten Islands, North Cape
              or Svalbard. Widerøe makes it easy to explore different parts of
              Norway. The airline flies to 41 destinations in Norway.
              <br /><br />
              From Oslo airport you can reach the center of the capital in just
              20 minutes thanks to the Flytoget express train. You can also
              catch various local buses and trains.

              You can get to Norway from Sweden, Denmark and Finland.
              <br /><br />
              There are buses leaving almost every hour from Gothenburg in
              Sweden and Copenhagen in Denmark. The bus service from Stockholm
              is also much more frequent than the trains. Several companies
              offer cheap tickets to travel between the largest cities in
              Norway, Denmark and Sweden. Generally, public transport in Norway
              is excellent. Buses, trains and ferries tend to run (mostly) on
              time, and cover most of the country.
              <br /><br />
              Express buses connect major airports to nearby cities or ferry
              terminals, while long-distance coaches between cities often have
              more luxurious seats, and more space for luggage. The railroad
              also connects to bus lines, with every end station connected to
              bus routes to more remote towns.
              <br /><br />
              If you’re traveling off the beaten track, the good news is that
              Norway’s public buses generally travel to even more remote areas
              of Norway. However, many buses on remote routes only run once or
              twice a day.
              <br /><br />
              You’ll need to be organized, and plan your route carefully in
              advance if you want to take the bus in more remote areas.

              If you arrive by car, you will most likely travel from Sweden,
              although Norway also has a land border with Russia and Finland. In
              any case, regardless of the country you arrive from, you will find
              customs controls at the border. In some points it is also
              necessary to pass a passport control.
              <br /><br />
              The main roads leading to Norway are the E6 European road, which
              runs through Malmö, Helsingborg and Gothenburg in Sweden, before
              entering Norway at Svinesund in the south-east of the country, and
              the E8 road, which runs through Turku, Vaasa and Oulu. , in
              Finland, before moving on to Norway at Kilpisjärvi.
              <br /><br />
              There are several car ferries between Norway (in Oslo and in the
              south of the country) and Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands.
              <br /><br />
              For a short stay, taking a car is pointless, but if like me you've
              got an extended trip, or if you're moving to Norway for a longer
              period, then taking a vehicle has many advantages.
              <br /><br />
              Firstly, the minute you set off, your holiday commences. You can
              take detours, stop in cities you have never visited before and
              travel at your own pace.
              <br /><br />
              The other plus point is that you can carry far more items with you
              when compared to flying; bikes, camping gear, sporting equipment
              etc. and it's much less hassle packing. Finally, if you plan on
              exploring Norway, a car makes things far more accessible for
              seeing Scandinavian scenery and landscapes.

              There are several ferry routes from Denmark, Germany, Sweden and
              the Netherlands. In Denmark, ferries depart from Copenhagen,
              Frederikshavn, and Hirtshals. In Germany they leave from Kiel, in
              Sweden they leave from Strömstad and in the Netherlands from
              Eemshaven.
              <br /><br />
              Most of the agencies offer service packages for cars that
              transport passengers and also discounts for retirees, students and
              children.
              <br /><br />
              If you want to get to Norway with your own boat, there are marinas
              with facilities available all along the coastline.
              <br /><br />
              Many cruise routes stop at Norwegian ports, especially in the
              fjord area and in coastal cities such as Bergen, Stavanger,
              Ålesund, Trondheim and Oslo. Some offer cruises to the Svalbard
              islands, Honningsvåg, Tromsø, Hammerfest and Bodø in northern
              Norway.
              <br /><br />
              From Denmark, there are quite a lot of ferries to Norway. Most
              boats go from the north of Denmark. Here you will find the
              shortest crossings, but also the boat that sails to Stavanger and
              Bergen. This last place is the northernmost destination in Norway
              from Denmark.
              <br /><br />
              There is also a crossing from the capital Copenhagen to Oslo. This
              is the longest crossing from Denmark to Norway.
              <br /><br />
              The ferries from Denmark are especially interesting for those who
              prefer driving over a long ferry crossing. On the Fjordline
              Superfast ferry, you only have to spend around 2 hours and 15
              minutes.

              Norway has an extensive rail network that connects it with the
              rest of Scandinavia and Europe. There are frequent train
              connections to Oslo from Copenhagen, Stockholm and Gothenburg.
              <br /><br />
              Most train journeys from mainland Europe occur overnight, and
              you'll find compartments with beds on all of them. There are
              several discount tickets available for train travel in Europe and
              Norway.
              <br /><br />
              Once in Norway, it is very easy to reach both Fjord Norway and the
              rest of the country by train, including Northern Norway, on some
              of the most spectacular rail routes in the world.
              <br /><br />
              Since railway in Norway is lengthy, there are many rail stations
              for the convenience of travelers. However, one of the more popular
              starting points for a Norwegian railway adventure is in the
              capital city Oslo.
              <br /><br />
              Many of the Norway routes start with a train leaving the country's
              largest station - Oslo Central Railway Station. Thus, take a
              virtual stroll around the station by watching the video on the
              left and learn how you could be spending your time before
              departure.
